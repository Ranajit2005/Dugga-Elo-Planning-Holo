              Durga Puja celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga over the demon king Mahishasura. <br />It begins on
              the same day as Navratri, a nine-night festival in many northern and western states of India(majorly
              celebrated in Bengal and Assam) that more broadly celebrates<br />
              the divine feminine(shakti).<br /><br />
              Saraswati, Laksmi, Kartik, Ganesh are considered as the daughters and sons (respectively) of Goddess
              Durga.<br /><br />Durga Puja’s first day is Mahalaya, which heralds the advent of the goddess (The
              Devipaksha starts ). Celebrations and worship begins on Sasthi, the sixth day. Lord Ganesh&#39;s<br />
              wife(Kolabou) is taken for an auspicios bathe in the ganga on Saptami,the seventh day. The main worship
              ritual is carried out on Asthami,the eight day in which the main attraction<br />
              is the Pushpanjali and Sondhey Arathi.<br /><br />On Navami, the ninth day, the goddess and her children
              are worshipped for the last time and the devotees are served with an Amish(non veg) feast.<br /><br />
              The celebrations end with Vijayadashami (“Tenth Day of Victory” ), when, amid loud chants <br />
              and drumbeats, sacred images are carried in huge processions to local rivers, where they are immersed.
              That custom is symbolic of the departure of the deity to her home and <br />
              to her husband, Shiva, in the Himalayas. Images of the goddess—astride a lion, attacking the demon king
              Mahishasura—are placed at various pandals (elaborately decorated bamboo <br />
              structures and galleries) and temples.
